	screen using the lcd_screen_virtual_to_real(). If you want to directly write to the real screen, just set the screen parameter of any of the above functions to NULL.
	\note Each virtual screen takes 24bytes of memory. It is less than the code that you would actually need to write to handle the cases where these functions are meant to be used. However, RAM memory on the ez430 chronos is limited too so use this with care!

	\brief Displays a single character
	\details Changes the <i>state</i> of <i>segment</i> state according to bits calculated from <i>chr</i>. If <i>screen</i> is NULL then this operation affects the real screen, otherwise it affects the screen pointed by <i>screen</i>.

	For example, the following line:<br />
	\code
	display_char(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3, 'C', SEG_SET);<br />
	\endcode
	Changes the bits of the 4th segment (from the right) of first line to show a 'C' character. The 'C' character is shown in the real screen.

	Another but a little more complex example:<br />
	\code
	// changes the bits of the 4th segment (from the right) of first line to show the '1' character in the real screen.
	display_char(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '1', SEG_SET);

	// makes all bits of the segment to blink. because only the bits corresponding to the '1' character are being shown, only the displayed '1' blinks.
	display_char(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '8', BLINK_ON);

	// changes the bits of the segment to show the '8' character. this operation doesn't change the blinking bits, so the displayed '8' will blink.
	display_char(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '8', SEG_SET);

	// turns off blinking for the bits corresponding to the '-' character. In this case because the bits of '8' were blinking, turning off '-' will make the bits of '0' continue blinking, while the '-' remains static.
	display_char(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3, '-', BLINK_OFF);
	\endcode
	\sa #display_chars()
*/
void display_char(
	struct lcd_screen *screen, /*!< pointer to the #lcd_screen storage */
	enum display_segment segment, /*!< A segment */
	uint8_t chr, /*!< The character to be displayed */
	enum display_segstate state /*!< A bitfield with state operations to be performed on the segment */
);


/*!
	\brief Displays several consecutive characters
	\details Smiliar to #display_char() except it works with a vector of chars.

	Example:<br />
	\code
	// changes the bits of the 4th to 1st segments (from the right) of the first line to show the "4321" string in the real screen.
	display_chars(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "4321", SEG_SET);

	// makes all bits of the first three segments to blink. because only the bits corresponding to the "4321" characters are being shown, only the first three displayed "432" segments blink.
	display_chars(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "888 ", BLINK_ON);

	// changes the bits of the segments to show the "8888" string. this operation doesn't change the blinking bits, so the first three displayed "888" segments will blink, while the last '8' segment is static.
	display_chars(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "8888", SEG_SET);

	// turns off blinking for the bits corresponding to the "----" characters. In this case because the bits of "888 " were blinking, turning off "----" will actually set the blinking bits to "000 ". Because the "8888" string is being displayed, only the first three "000" bits will blink, the first three "---" bits will remain static and the last segment remains static.
	display_chars(NULL, LCD_SEG_L1_3_0, "----", BLINK_OFF);
	\endcode
	Also, passing NULL as the <i>str</i> argument is equivalent of passing a vector of '8' characters. Consider the previous example, where the string "8888" can equivalently be replaced with NULL.
